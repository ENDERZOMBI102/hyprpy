Pyprland
========

**Welcome to the Pyprland documentation!**

Pyprland is a library which provides python bindings for the `Hyprland <https://hyprland.org/>`_
window compositor.
With Pyprland, you can retrieve information about windows, workspaces and monitors,
and react to Hyprland events using pure Python.

Pyprland communicates with Hyprland using unix sockets, making it *fast* and *efficient*.
It also provides a versatile and resource-friendly signalling interface. With it,
you can write python callbacks for Hyprland events.

To get started, install Pyprland and follow along with the :ref:`Components guide <guide>`,
or dive straight into the extensive :ref:`API reference <api>`.
